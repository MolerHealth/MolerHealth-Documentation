# MolerHealth - Revolutionizing Healthcare in Nigeria

## Introduction

**MolerHealth** is an open-source Electronic Health Records (EHR) application designed to transform healthcare in Nigeria. Through this project, our aim is to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers by offering a seamless, user-friendly platform where comprehensive health records can be accessed, updated, and shared.

## Project Description

The core objective of MolerHealth is to tackle the prevalent issue of disease misdiagnosis in Nigeria. By creating a centralized digital hub for health records, we aim to ensure that medical professionals have access to the complete health histories of their patients. This aids in accurate diagnosis, timely referrals, and appropriate treatment decisions.

Key Features:
- **Patient-Centric**: Patients can access, update, and share their health records.
- **Comprehensive Profiles**: Records include medical history, test results, medications, allergies, and treatment plans.
- **Collaboration**: A platform for healthcare providers to communicate securely, facilitating better patient care.
- **Open Source**: Encouraging community participation, innovation, and adaptability.

## The Problem

Disease misdiagnosis is a significant issue in Nigeria's healthcare system. The lack of centralized health records often results in redundant tests and inaccurate diagnoses, adversely affecting patient outcomes.

One tragic story that embodies this issue is the loss of my sister Kenny to Lupus - a condition that was misdiagnosed as typhoid. Due to the absence of her comprehensive health records, she did not receive accurate treatment in time. 

## Importance of the Project

Stories like Kenny's are not isolated. Many in Nigeria have been victims of misdiagnoses, causing untold pain to families and unnecessary loss of life. MolerHealth is not just a project; it's a mission to ensure that no one else has to suffer due to systemic healthcare issues.
